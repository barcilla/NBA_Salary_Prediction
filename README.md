# NBA_Salary_Prediction

In this project, I trained classification models to predict % of NBA Team Salary Cap. 6 models were evaluated: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. AdaBoost performed the best as it gave a high accuracy score along with a good recall score across the labels.
