# NBA_Salary_Prediction

NBA Free Agency is an exciting time for the NBA and it's fans. NBA teams could be trying to find the type of player that over-performs what they are currently getting paid or players who may have had a bad season and is currently under performing what they are getting paid. Having a model that can identify these players could be helpful in trying to find solutions that best fit their financial situation. In this project, I trained classification models on player statistics to predict which salary cap percentage "bucket" the player falls in. This "bucket" consist of the percentage that the players' salary takes up against the team's salary cap: 0-10%, 10-15%, 15-20%, 20-25%, >=25%.  There were 6 models evaluated: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. AdaBoost performed the best as it gave a high accuracy score.
